## 🌙 Behind the Project

**BeEla** began as a playful creative experiment — a fusion of art, humor, and code.  
It explores how design and storytelling can transform even simple web forms into emotional experiences.  
Every color, font, and line of code was chosen to reflect tenderness, irony, and the magic of human connection.  

> *Made with warmth, wit, and a bit of digital stardust ✨*
